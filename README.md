## Overview
 
Vcov is a free and open‑source C/C++ code coverage tool for [Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio?view=visualstudio) solutions on Windows. It is actively maintained as a fork of the [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage) project.
Since the original project is no longer actively maintained, Vcov continues its development and improvement.

Its primary use case is unit test coverage, but it can also be used to track executed lines in a program for debugging purposes.

This tool is constantly evolving, and contributions are always welcome! Learn how to get started with our [packaging tutorial]() and [maintainer guide]().

## Get Started

First, follow one of our quick start guides.

- Windows Vista or higher
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or higher (all editions, **including Express edition**) , It may also work with earlier versions of Visual Studio.

## Use Vcov

You can run Vcov with the following command:

```bash
vcov.exe --sources MySourcePath* -- YourProgram.exe arg1 arg2
```

For example, *MySourcePath* can be *MyProject*, if your sources are located in *C:\Dev\MyProject*.

See [Getting Started](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage/wiki) for more information about the usage.
